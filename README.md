# OpenGL-Tutorials-List

These are some tutorials which I used (and I'm still using) for learing basics of OpenGL and computer graphics.

[Tom Dalling Blog: Modern OpenGL](http://www.tomdalling.com/blog/category/modern-opengl/) - A nice series of OpenGL tutorials also 
explaining underlying math behind the basic computer graphics. Has some useful pictures, illustrations and graphs.

[Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/#!Introduction) - A full guide for modern OpenGL and computer graphics. It takes you to
the journey from the very beginning to some advanced stuff providing full explanation and illustrations. The best guide explaining math
behind OpenGL.
May be used as a textbook of modern OpenGL.
Highly recommended.

[ICS: Fixed Function to Modern OpenGL](http://www.ics.com/blog/fixed-function-modern-opengl-part-1-4) - This 4-parts guid is actual for
people are using OpenGL 2.0 with fixed function pipeline and want to switch to OpenGL 3.0+. As a name implies, it shows how to implement fixed-function features in 
a modern OpenGL way.

[The Benny Box: Intro To Modern OpenGL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEETnX-uPtBXT9T-hD0Bj31DSnwio-ywh) - This is the one
I began with when starting to learn OpenGL. Still personally my favorite. The real value of this tutorial not in OpenGL knowlege itself
but rather in a way it is presented. Doing live coding tutor explains OpenGL concepts and how to implement them. However, unlike a bunch
of others OpenGL tutorials (most of them) he also shows how to structure your OpenGL code properly. At the end of this tutorial you'll
have your own small rendering engine organised in OOP way. A brilliant point to start for a newbie.
